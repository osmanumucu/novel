On this particular morning, the village was waking up to a symphony of bird songs and the gentle caress of the early sun. Among its inhabitants was young Elara, with hair as dark as the raven's wing and eyes reflecting the deep blue of the twilight sky. She lived in the last cottage at the edge of the village, where the wildflowers grew more freely and the trees leaned in a little closer, as if to whisper their secrets.
